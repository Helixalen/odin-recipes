        <h3>What is It???</h3>
        <p>This is butter chicken, but made with chickpeas instead of chicken. (You can also add chicken if you're feeling extra.)</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Group 1</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups finely chopped onion (about 1 large onion)</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves crushed</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons crushed ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Group 2</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons kasoori methi (dried fenugreek leaves)</li>
            <li>2 and 1/2 teaspoons coriander powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper powder or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            <li>1 15 oz can tomato sauce or blanched and pureed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/4 plus 2 tablespoons raw cashews made into a fine powder</li>
            <li>2 15 oz cans chickpeas drained and rinsed or 3 cups cooked chickpeas</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup water</li>
        </ul>
        A note about making cashew powder: Grind raw cashews into a fine powder using any dry spice grinder or coffee grinder. Stop the grinder every few seconds and give a good shake and continue grinding. This step is important, since cashew powder will start clumping up due to the high fat content.
        <h4>Group 3</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, add butter and let melt.</li>
            <li>Add cumin seeds and let it toast for about 10 seconds and then stir in chopped onion, crushed garlic, ginger and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring often, until onions get golden brown color (4-5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Add kasoori methi, coriander powder, cayenne and garam masala powder. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, until spices are toasted well (don't let it burn).</li>
            <li>Add tomato sauce, cashew powder, chickpeas and ¼ cup water stir well, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 10 minutes (stirring every 3-4 minutes to make sure that it does not burn on the bottom).</li>
