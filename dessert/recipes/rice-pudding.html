        <h3>What is It???</h3>
        My mother-in-law makes this recipe and <em>wow</em> it's good. It's rice, but sweet and creamy. Amazing.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk (16 oz)</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream (8 oz)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar (1.75 oz)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sushi or Arborio rice (4 oz) Long grain white rice can also be used, but the texture may be slightly less creamy.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the milk, 3/4 cup cream, sugar, rice, and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Can also be made with a larger slow cooker, depending on if the recipe is doubled or more.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently for 30-40 minutes, until thickened. This is very similar to cooking risotto. If using a slow cooker, set to high heat and stay nearby to stir frequently. Scrape the bottom to ensure nothing is sticking.</li>
            <li>Test the rice to ensure it's done. You want a firm bite, but no crunchy center to the kernel.</li>
            <li>Remove the pudding from the heat and stir in the remaining 1/4 cup cream, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Serve warm or chilled. Sprinkle ground cinnamon on top if desired.</li>
        </ol>
        Yield: about 2 cups pudding.
