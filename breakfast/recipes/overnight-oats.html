        <h3>What is It???</h3>
        This is oatmeal, but for people who have better things to do than standing around cooking oatmeal every morning.
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup steel-cut oats</li>
            <li>1 cup dried cranberries</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dried figs or dates (remove the pits)</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>pinch kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the oats, cranberries, figs, water, and cream in a slow cooker and set to low heat. Cover and cook for 8 to 9 hours.</li>
            <li>Stir, season with salt, to taste, and remove to serving bowls. This method works best if started before you go to bed. This way, your oatmeal will be finished by morning.</li>
